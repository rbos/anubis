# rustc enables reference-types, multivalue and friends by default for
# wasm32-unknown-unknown. With reference-types on, LLVM encodes the call_indirect
# table index as an overlong LEB128 (80 80 80 80 00) rather than the MVP's single
# reserved 0x00 byte. Engines predating the proposal read one byte, see 0x80, and
# refuse to compile the module:
#
#	CompileError: expected table index 0, found 128
#
# Clearing the features with -Ctarget-feature is not enough, because the shipped
# std rlibs are already encoded that way; fixing it at the source would mean
# rebuilding std on nightly. Instead each module is round-tripped through wasm-opt
# against the feature set that its oldest supported browser actually implements.
# That re-emits the MVP call_indirect encoding, and makes wasm-opt reject the
# module outright if it ever picks up a feature not on the list, so a toolchain
# upgrade becomes a loud build failure rather than a browser that cannot start.
#
# Keep this a pure decode/re-encode with no optimization passes: the wasm build of
# wasm-opt exhausts its stack on -O2, and we would rather not have an optimizer
# rewriting proof-of-work code.
#
# Chrome shipped sign-ext and mutable-globals in 74, bulk-memory and
# nontrapping-fptoint in 75, multivalue in 85 and simd in 91.
